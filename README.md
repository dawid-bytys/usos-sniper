Making it public because I have already finished my studies and will not be useful to me again. In the last 3 years I managed to snipe about 20 subjects. I recommend to run it on some VPS (if you have .edu mail you have access to Google Cloud for free) and using pm2 or some other deamon to make it run 24/7. You can run as many instances of this script as you want, usos is sh\*\* and doesnt have requests limit.
