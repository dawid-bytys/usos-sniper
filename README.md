I'm making this public since I have completed my studies and won't need it anymore. Over the past three years, I've successfully sniped about 20 lectures using this script. I recommend running it on a VPS (if you have a .edu email, you can access Google Cloud for free) and using PM2 or another daemon to keep it running 24/7. You can run as many instances of this script as you like. The USOS system is sh** designed and doesn't have request limits.
